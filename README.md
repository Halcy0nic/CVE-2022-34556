# Description of CVE-2022-34556

PicoC v3.2.2 was discovered to contain a NULL pointer dereference at variable.c. Any project or library that uses Picoc also suffers from this issue. An example of this would be [picoc-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/picoc-js).

### Setting up our environment

To replicate the null pointer dereference vulnerability in PicoC, we must first download and compile a vulnerable version (v3.2.2) of the PicoC library and interpreter:

```
git clone https://github.com/jpoirier/picoc.git
cd picoc
git checkout a97d94fa3d4d35c6b78b7de69faac7643e34de22
make
```

# Reproduction Steps

1. Execute the interpreter in script mode against the **poc.c** file included in this repository:

```
$ ./picoc -s poc.c
```

You will receive a segfault and the program will crash. This is a result of a null pointer dereference that is not caught or handled by the library or interpreter.
